                <p>Ken Adams was called as the first pastor of Crossroads Church in Newnan, Georgia in 1989. He was passionate about the Great Commission and wanted his church to be a part of the movement and mission of Jesus. Ken wanted everything at Crossroads to revolve around being and building disciples of Jesus.</p>

                <p>In the early 1990s, Crossroads was well on its way multiplying disciples, but the church was having a major problem finding resources that would accomplish its mission. While a lot of resources provided insight on how to have a discipleship program in a church, there were few resources that taught how to build a church that entirely revolved around a Jesus-style strategy for disciple making.</p>

              <div class="timeline-content">
                <p>Out of this need, Ken began writing his own curriculum for Crossroads. He emphasized important topics in his writing like how to define a disciple, how to train a disciple, how to multiply disciples, and how to create church and small group environments that multiply disciples. Ken’s curriculum was a huge hit with the Crossroads, and pretty soon, disciples and small groups were multiplying exponentially in the church.</p>

                <p>Under Ken’s leadership, Crossroads has grown to 3,000+ in attendance, meets on three campuses, and has planted eight other churches as of 2020.
                  In 2001, Ken decided to make his resources available to other churches. He founded Impact Discipleship Ministries as a non-profit of Crossroads Church specifically for the purpose of providing disciple making resources and training.
                  Today, Impact Discipleship Ministries serves pastors, churches, and individuals all over the world.
