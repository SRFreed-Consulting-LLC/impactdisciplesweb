    <p>Please be advised that any opt out rights described below will not apply with the sharing of information necessary for us to process applications, such as with consumer reporting agencies, or to perform services that you request.</p>
    <h6><strong>Registration</strong></h6>
    <p>In order to purchase from this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their full contact information. This information is used to evaluate the application and contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.</p>
    <h6><strong>Order</strong></h6>
    <p>We request information from consumers making purchases within our shopping cart and order processing interfaces. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used to fill customer’s orders, for billing purposes, and to verify the identity of the consumer to protect against fraud. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.</p>
    <h6><strong>Cookies</strong></h6>
    <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. The cookie will contain the user’s username so that the web site will recognize the user on subsequent visits. The user’s password can optionally be stored in the cookie at the user’s request so there is no need to enter it on every visit to the site. The cookie will also contain the user’s preferences on what information will be shown to them on the home page. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>
    <h6><strong>Log Files</strong></h6>
    <p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
    <h6><strong>Security </strong></h6>
    <p>This website takes precautions to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number, and/or Federal Tax ID), that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.</p>
    <h6><strong>Links</strong></h6>
    <p>This web site may at times contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we [Brentwood Baptist Church] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to info&#64;impactdisciples.com</p>
    <h6><strong>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</strong></h6>
    <p>If a user’s nonpublic personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done by emailing us at info&#64;impactdisciples.com for more instructions.</p>
    <h6><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></h6>
    <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our contact us page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email so as to enable users to “opt-out” if we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
